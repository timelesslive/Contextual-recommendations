# PyTorch Implementation of Deep Interest Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction

### Overview

This repository contains code unofficially reimplemented the original paper ***KDD 2018 Deep Interest Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction*** in PyTorch version

### To-Dos

- [x] Simple Architecture Reimplementation
- [x] Dice Activation / PReLU
- [ ] Data Evaluation (not trained yet)
- [x] Dropout
- [ ] Regularization in DiFacto
- [ ] Mini-Batch Aware (MBA) regularization
